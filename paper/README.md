## Paper Title

**Lightweight Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Local Networks**

## Summary

This paper presents:
- A hybrid IDS combining rule-based filtering and unsupervised
  anomaly detection
- Implementation details for packet capture, rule engine,
  and clustering-based anomaly detection
- Evaluation using synthesized network traffic

## How to use this paper

- Understand the architecture before diving into the code
- Use it to inform experiment replication
- It corresponds to the implementations in `src/`
